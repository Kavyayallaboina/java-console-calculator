# Basic Java Calculator — Elevate Labs Internship Task
This repository contains my submission for the Elevate Labs Internship Task, developed in Java.  
It is a simple yet functional *console-based calculator* that performs basic arithmetic operations using user input

# Project Overview
This Java program allows users to perform *addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division* operations.  
It uses a Scanner for input and includes a looping mechanism that lets users perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

# Features
- Written in *pure Java*
- Uses *methods* for each arithmetic operation  
- Includes *error handling* for division by zero  
- Allows multiple calculations in one run  
- Clean and beginner-friendly structure  

 # Technologies Used
- Language: Java  
- Concepts Used: Methods, Switch Case, Loops, Conditionals, Scanner Input  
 
 # How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kavyayallaboina/java-console-calculator. git
## sample output
   ===== BASIC JAVA CALCULATOR =====
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
